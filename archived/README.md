# Archived Versions

This directory contains historical versions of the Pin-Ball game that are no longer in active development. These are preserved for reference and historical purposes.

## Directory Structure

- `v1.0-v2.0/` - Version 1.0 to 2.0 (early versions with maze pipe system, sports-themed obstacles)
- `v3.0/` - Version 3.0 (enhanced with animation system, particle effects, etc.)
- `v4.0-backup/` - Backup of assets that were moved from root directory during reorganization

## Current Active Version

The current active development version is **v4.0**, which is located in the root project directory. v4.0 features:
- Character-themed zones (Android Acres, Dino Desert, etc.)
- Enhanced visual effects and particle systems
- Backbox management system
- Skill shot mechanics
- And more...

## Purpose of Archiving

These versions are archived to:
1. Keep the main project directory clean and focused on current development
2. Preserve historical work for reference
3. Allow comparison between versions if needed
4. Provide backup in case specific assets or code from older versions are needed

## Notes

- Godot project files (.godot, .import) may reference paths that have changed
- To use an archived version, you may need to update resource paths
- The `v4.0-backup/` directory contains assets that were in the root directory but may still be referenced by v4.0 scenes
